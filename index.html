                <h2>Why care for birds?</h2>
                <p class="para">So why should we make the effort to learn all we can about avian husbandry? Pet birds, budgies in particular, are often bought for children as 'cheap' and 'easy' pets - but this is far from the truth! In reality, parrots are extremely intelligent and demanding, and require (and deserve!) a great deal of care. Parrots can't thrive if they are locked up in a cage all day, fed an improper diet, and not properly stimulated. It's our job to make sure our feathered friends receive the excellent care they deserve!
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Living with birds, while difficult, can be extremely rewarding! For all the effort you put into their care, you will be rewarded with an intelligent, interesting, companion to share your home with.</p>
