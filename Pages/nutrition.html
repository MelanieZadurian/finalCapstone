                <p class="para">Nutrition is one of the most important aspects, if not the single most important aspect, of good avian husbandry. 50 years ago, many people kept parrots as pets and believed that feeding them only seed, with the occasional treat, was perfectly fine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thankfully, avian nutrition has evolved since then, and we now have a far better understanding of what makes a good parrot diet. </p>

                <h2>Daily diet</h2>

                <p class="para">While the ideal parrot diet does vary depending on species, and we are still learning more about avian nutrition all the time, a good rule of thumb is that a parrot's diet should consist of roughly 60% formulated pellets, 25% high nutrition vegetables, and 15% seed/the occasional treat.
                    <br>
                    <br>Often it can be difficult to convert a parrot over to a mostly-pelleted diet, so it might require trying out a few different brands of pellets! One brand I would particularly recommend is Harrison's. Below is a table showing their recommended feeding guidelines for a few different parrots:</p>

                <h2>Bird-safe Vegetables</h2>

                <p class="para">Vegetables are such a crucial part of your parrot's diet, but it can be difficult to know where to begin! Lots of parrot owners find that their birds prefer vegetables served as 'chop' - a mix of different vegetables chopped up finely together. You could also clip veg up around your birds cage/living area - damp leafy greens and tenderstem brocolli work particularly well for this. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Below is a list of bird-safe vegetables to help you get started!</p>

                    Good options for treats include: sunflower seeds, freeze-dried fruit, small pieces of fruit, and nuts. Remember: human treats are <b>not</b> good treats for your parrot!</p>
