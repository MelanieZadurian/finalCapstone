<!--This is the html file for the second page (My Birds) of a website on Avian Husbandry, which is something I am interested in.
Across this page, and the other pages of my website, I have made sure to include all the requirements listed in the compulsory task.

I have left this the same, except for slight additions to meet the new requirements of task 42.
I have made sure that all my images have like buttons and save buttons.-->
