                <!--This div contains an introductory paragraph about enrichment-->

                <p class="para">Many parrots are as intelligent as human toddlers, so it's really important to keep their brains active! A bored parrot is an unhappy parrot, and in fact boredom can lead to very real health issues for birds. Plucking is a condition that is often caused by a lack of enrichment, and something that we really want to avoid!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Below are some ideas to think about, when you come to provide enrichment for your feathered friend!</p>
            </div>

            <div id="foraging">
                <!--This div contains the h2 heading 'Foraging', along with a short paragraph about this-->

                <h2>Foraging</h2>

                <p class="para">Foraging is a really important part of enrichment for your parrot! In the while, birds spend a lot of their time foraging, either in trees or on the ground, and we want to replicate that natural impulse with our pet birds too!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can buy or make foraging toys, ranging in difficulty from super simple (as easy as just adding some shredded strips of paper over their food bowl!) to very complex. Try to understand your parrots starting skill level, and work with them on developing their foraging ability!</p>

            </div>

            <div id="toys">
                <!--This div contains the h2 heading 'Toys', along with a short paragraph about this, and a radio form about your bird's species.
                As mentioned in the compulsory task, this form doesn't actually do anything at the moment.
                This div also contains a link to the Northern Parrots website.-->

                <h2>Toys</h2>

                <p class="para">All birds need toys! Toys that can be destroyed/shredded are particularly important, though having to constantly re-buy these can be pricey!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's a good idea to provide your bird with a mix of store-bought and home-made toys. All kinds of things can be toys, from shredded paper to cardboard tubes! Your bird is likely to have certain kinds of toys that they prefer, so it's your job to work out which ones they most enjoy.
